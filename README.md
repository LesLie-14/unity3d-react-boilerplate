# Unity3D-React-Boilerplate
Boilerplate for Unity3D WebGL builds (on WebAssembly) using basic Create React App

## What I wanna do here
Prepare an easy to use boilerplate for Unity WebGL builds in react. Which also shows you step by step how to do it on your own.
 - [ ] Prepare basic webproject: Running Create React App
 - [ ] Make basic unity WebGL build
 - [ ] Implement crucial repo for this project: [react-unity-webgl](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/react-unity-webgl)
 - [ ] Introducing basic communication between React and Unity build
 - [ ] Hosting on Heroku

## How to recreate
#### 1. Initial project setup
:milky_way: Follow this repo: [Heroku Buildpack for create-react-app](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack)
 With just a few easy steps  you end with a static, frontend-only web site hosted on Heroku.
 Easygoing heroku buildpack, look through it's readme, interesting stuff.

Simple site updating with commiting and pushing changes to heroku remote(?):
